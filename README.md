# Final-Project
# Project Hypothesis

How has the interannual variability, seasonal onset timing, and spatial distribution of rainfall during Ghana’s primary rainy season (March–June) evolved over the period 2000–2020?  
We want to understand whether the timing, intensity, and variability of Ghana’s main rainy season (March–June) has changed from 2000 to 2020.

# Data Source

We will use **CHIRPS v2.0 daily precipitation data**:  
*Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS)*  
Global daily GeoTIFFs (p05):

# Analysis Plan

We will crop daily CHIRPS data to Ghana for 2000–2020 and calculate national-average daily rainfall time series.  
We will analyze annual totals, interannual variability, and the timing of rainy season onset using rolling means.  
Finally, we will visualize trends with time series plots and spatial variability maps to assess changes in rainfall patterns over Ghana.
